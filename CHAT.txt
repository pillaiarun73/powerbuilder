seroiusly ... i didnt have any audio issue..from start
from nkusare to All Participants:
yes
from Abhishek Upadhyay to All Participants:
ii didn't have a issue from starrt
from Rai.coldcharm to All Participants:
audio is also unstructured
from nkusare to All Participants:
all good
from Anjal Angrevar to All Participants:
feature extraction ?
from Shyam1944 to All Participants:
Modelling?  expalion
from S.chebrolu to All Participants:
do we have capability now in NLP to address all the challenges we discussed?
from Kaushik.banerjee to All Participants:
yes
from Justrawraza007 to All Participants:
just basic models
from ragavanveerarajan to All Participants:
how can we feed audio data in this pipeline?
from Haryormyde to All Participants:
yes
from Rohit9 to All Attendees:
when we will get the break !
from Shyam1944 to All Participants:
Dont recollect modeling
from Rai.coldcharm to All Participants:
neural nets and deep learning systems are good in dealing with unprocessed data... so why the need to spend much time of processing
from ragavanveerarajan to All Participants:
how can we convert audio file into text file?
from Quamar313 to All Participants:
is a
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
why its called noise entity removal?
from Mk5491 to All Participants:
is 
from Mk5491 to All Participants:
a
from Vaishusony8 to All Participants:
a
from Haryormyde to All Participants:
is , a
from Mohammed Roshan Zameer to All Participants:
wow, abished is so lucky ;)
from Gitanjali.nandi to All Participants:
is,a
from Gitanjali.nandi to All Participants:
yes
from Contactsahilshetty18  to All Participants:
Yes
from Vaishusony8 to All Participants:
yes
from nkusare to All Participants:
yes
from Justrawraza007 to All Participants:
yes
from Quamar313 to All Participants:
URLs?
from Justrawraza007 to All Participants:
capital letter
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
meaning is same
from Justrawraza007 to All Participants:
meaning is same
from Mk5491 to All Participants:
same
from Sundarresan86 to All Participants:
same
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
similar in meaning but.different in term of syntax
from Vaishusony8 to All Participants:
convert to lowercase
from Rai.coldcharm to All Participants:
'it' can be noise..'IT' is a term...how will it work
from Chandra Sekhar Mukhopadhyay to All Participants:
ok
from Vaishusony8 to All Participants:
word tokenization
from Rai.coldcharm to All Participants:
capital is an abbrevation..
from nkusare to All Participants:
verb form?
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
but meaning will changes right if we do stemming
from Sundarresan86 to All Participants:
no sir
from Anjal Angrevar to All Participants:
stemming?
from ragavanveerarajan to All Participants:
can u explain stemming again
from Sangitapandey15 to All Participants:
please explain tokenization
from Vibhutimayekar to All Participants:
can u repeat tokenization
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
are u going to explain in detail stemming and lemmatization difference?
from Anjal Angrevar to All Participants:
ok
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
ye s stemming check root word right then what lemmatization do?
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
is it only for ing's
from Justrawraza007 to All Participants:
word normaliztion deals with grammar issues
from Sangitapandey15 to All Participants:
please explain again
from Sangitapandey15 to All Participants:
the earlier slide
from Rai.coldcharm to All Participants:
capital and lower case can mean different things...how does nlp solves this prob...
from Sangitapandey15 to All Participants:
can someone tell abput lemmatization and tokenization
from Contactsahilshetty18  to All Participants:
Why not everything to uppercase
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
ok
from Haryormyde to All Participants:
clear
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
good
from Nitesh0362 to All Participants:
ASCII Values r different
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
yes tokenization is like --- he is nice person so we split every word as one entity 
like 1) he. 2) is. 3) a 4) nice. 5)person
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
in next slide we have example about tokenization
from Vcsishere to All Participants:
break
from Vaishusony8 to All Participants:
finding the root word like occupying -->occupy
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
so sir how stemming is different from lemmatization
from Sangitapandey15 to All Participants:
okay...Thanks:-)
from Shyam1944 to All Participants:
not clear why remove unque words?
from Sbsen_21 to All Participants:
voice breaking
from eschimhaka  to All Participants:
chat box blocking ppt and ur voice is breaking
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
yes
from Justrawraza007 to All Participants:
yes
from Vibhutimayekar to All Participants:
ok clear now
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
yes
from Contactsahilshetty18  to All Participants:
Do we remove stop words in tokenisation 
from Ashrafji100 to All Participants:
clear now
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
better explanation got it.
from nkusare to All Participants:
its like giving token number to word..
from Sbsen_21 to All Participants:
tokenization come first
from Contactsahilshetty18  to All Participants:
Ok
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
stop word?
from Contactsahilshetty18  to All Participants:
Understood thank you 
from Sundarresan86 to All Participants:
two types of token-1.sent_tokenize 2.word_tokenize
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
k
from Gitanjali.nandi to All Participants:
no
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
no
from Rai.coldcharm to All Participants:
deep learning system work well with unprocessed data... why the need for so much processing
from nkusare to All Participants:
no
from Sundarresan86 to All Participants:
no
from Ashrafji100 to All Participants:
no
from Contactsahilshetty18  to All Participants:
Sir I have 
from Justrawraza007 to All Participants:
one sec'
from Satish.jaiswal.aum to All Participants:
benefits of tokenization
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
no good so far with tokenization part
from Contactsahilshetty18  to All Participants:
What if there is a ?
from Contactsahilshetty18  to All Participants:
Is that a separate token as well
from Justrawraza007 to All Participants:
sir what do we do first 
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
I mean good sir
from Justrawraza007 to All Participants:
noisy removal or tokeniztion
from Vibhutimayekar to All Participants:
sir can u please share with the syllabus...excited to know about what are we going to learn..
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
got it tokenization
from Maryghosh1910 to All Participants:
clear
from Vaishusony8 to All Participants:
tokenization is like breaking a paragraph into words or sentences
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
got it go ahead
from ragavanveerarajan to All Participants:
no
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
plurals
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
play
from Contactsahilshetty18  to All Participants:
But each “play” means something else so how does the system account for that 
from nkusare to All Participants:
does it removes prefix also?
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
but it is meaningless right
from Quamar313 to All Participants:
but studi doesnot mean anything
from nkusare to All Participants:
ok
from Quamar313 to All Participants:
got it
from Sangitapandey15 to All Participants:
but player and play are different 
from nkusare to All Participants:
ys
from Rai.coldcharm to All Participants:
both are used or is it stemming or lemmatization..
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
normally how much time will it take for a word?
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
sir for selecting algorithm it based on problem and on data
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
in Lemma ....what is the logic used? sorry could not understand with this example
from Justrawraza007 to All Participants:
plz explain lemmitiztion again
from Shyam1944 to All Participants:
Why not use both?
from Vibhutimayekar to All Participants:
@Saroj: it converts the word in short and which makes sense
from Justrawraza007 to All Participants:
how it is different from stemming
from Lijupvarghese to All Participants:
we will have to create the lookup table ?
from Vaishusony8 to All Participants:
@justra - stemming does not give meaningful root word
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
so lemma is advanced version of stemming with having root word for table
from Rohit9 to All Attendees:
sir when we will get break for dinner
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Attendees:
wait my friend it will be on 9:30 pm

there is no space b/w 53 and % still it tokenized as 2 words?
from Anjal Angrevar to All Participants:
where to get the files 
from Anjal Angrevar to All Participants:
ok
from Justrawraza007 to All Participants:
sir is it different from the dataset given in self learning videos
from Anjal Angrevar to All Participants:
i think drive is shared that is why ,
from Vcsishere to All Participants:
can you someone share the drink link once
from Rohitgauravmishra to All Participants:
What is the point of opening practice lab then?
from Rohitgauravmishra to All Participants:
ok
from Shyam1944 to All Participants:
what does "isalpha" do?
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
guys kindly wait just for now.
from Chintachandan to All Participants:
checks if the letters are alphabetical or not
from Shyam1944 to All Participants:
ok
from Justrawraza007 to All Participants:
ok
from Mukammilbasha90 to All Participants:
ok
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
but can u atleast explain the objective of each process?
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
what is alpha?
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
we dont see the comments in the code
from Chandniprerna14 to All Participants:
isalpha is to show anything other than stopwords right?
from Rai.coldcharm to All Participants:
doesn't stop words play role in context understanding.. why remove them
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
Is stopwords are already in package?
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
so in isalpha it is checking alphabet if it get no then it neglected it.
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
thats why bit difficult to understand
from Gitanjali.nandi to All Participants:
isalpha means?
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
What is the use of those stopwords? give an example?
from Maryghosh1910 to All Participants:
what is the use of stopwards
from Quamar313 to All Participants:
only this much stopwords??
from Rai.coldcharm to All Participants:
doesn't stop words play role in context understanding.. why remove them
from ragavanveerarajan to All Participants:
what are the other stemming techniques?
from Vcsishere to All Participants:
dont we losse the context if we remove stop words like doesnt
from Tushar9604 to All Participants:
what does stemming do?
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
percentag
from Lijupvarghese to All Participants:
its just trimming ?
from Vcsishere to All Participants:
how do we overcome this
from Anjal Angrevar to All Participants:
what is porterstammer ?
from Mukammilbasha90 to All Participants:
s
from Anjal Angrevar to All Participants:
ok
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
how to resolve these issues?
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
sir in stemming again we get no 2019-2020 like this is it not deleted in previous permanently
from Tushar9604 to All Participants:
ok
from Rai.coldcharm to All Participants:
NLP for chatbots require use of stop words.. if we don't  include stop words..how do models gets trained
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
okay
from Mohammed Roshan Zameer to All Participants:
sir, u answer all the questions in the end. It breaks the teaching flow
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
so we are ignoring all alphanumeric word?
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
ok
from Anjal Angrevar to All Participants:
sir, please remove chat window
from Shashank536.sr to All Participants:
please close the chat box
from Quamar313 to All Participants:
no use of usewords

How a special character is treated by nltk
from Lijupvarghese to All Participants:
sir your window looks small 
from Quamar313 to All Participants:
may be remove the spcl char
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
what happens if the sentence  contains Not. so if we use NLTK stopword lib then will it remove NOT?
from Rai.coldcharm to All Participants:
most of text data on social media like twitter rarely follow rules of grammer.... does nlp requires proper english
from Gitanjali.nandi to All Participants:
yes
from Gitanjali.nandi to All Participants:
understood
from Quamar313 to All Participants:
plz place chat window on left side
from Maryghosh1910 to All Participants:
stopwords sir
from Maryghosh1910 to All Participants:
what is the use of stopwords
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
can we select particular stop words from the list
from Allan.gaulin to All Participants:
stopwords are irrelevant words
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
k
from Tushar9604 to All Participants:
in this demo we saw how to tokenize, remove stopwords, and how to stemmize the text data. Also to check for alphabetical words in text.
from Quamar313 to All Participants:
why use three times """
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
is it follows the slash in the example and sentence it
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
will it remove duplicate word?
from Rai.coldcharm to All Participants:
most of ml class makes use of ndarray for data storage as its highly efficient..but nlp uses builtin list...why?
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
ok
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
corpus?
from Mohammed Roshan Zameer to All Participants:
sir, voice is breaking a little bit
from Mohammed Roshan Zameer to All Participants:
meaning its not clear
from Quamar313 to All Participants:
it break didn't into did and n't
from Sbsen_21 to All Attendees:
voice breaking
from Justrawraza007 to All Participants:
no sir got it
from Rai.coldcharm to All Participants:
most of ml class makes use of ndarray for data storage as its highly efficient..but nlp uses builtin list...why?
from nkusare to All Participants:
got it
from Pramodnaik40 to All Participants:
Can just explain once from top
from Kaushik.banerjee to All Participants:
does word tokenize pick only unique occurences of word
from Mohammed Roshan Zameer to All Participants:
lets move on sir!
from Mukkajagbhushan  to All Participants:
is there is letter tokenizer as well ??
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
got it but sir in sentence tokenize it also see first full stop to take it as one complete sentence. of comma
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
collect of text or words?
from Chintachandan to All Participants:
yes
from Allan.gaulin to All Participants:
yes
from Abhishek Upadhyay to All Participants:
yes
from Gitanjali.nandi to All Participants:

from Justrawraza007 to All Participants:
yes
from Anjal Angrevar to All Participants:
y
from Tushar9604 to All Participants:
yes audible
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
Corpus: is it collection of text or word?
from Gitanjali.nandi to All Participants:
no
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
no
from Kaushik.banerjee to All Participants:
does word tokenizer pick only unique occurences of word
from Shyam1944 to All Participants:
y
from Sbsen_21 to All Attendees:
plz close chat window
from Kaushik.banerjee to All Participants:
ok..
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
got it in  better manner
from Justrawraza007 to All Participants:
little bit 
from Vaishusony8 to All Participants:
corpus is used for stopwords
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
okay
from Rai.coldcharm to All Participants:
special char.. are removed
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
do we have any package for special characters like stopwords?
from Justrawraza007 to All Participants:
threee times
from Rai.coldcharm to All Participants:
3
from Mohammed Roshan Zameer to All Participants:
just because it had hypen
from nkusare to All Participants:
ok
from Rai.coldcharm to All Participants:
how is word tokenizer different from white space tokenizer... they seem same
from Shashank536.sr to All Participants:
is word tokenizer is same as whitespace tokenizer?
from Vaishusony8 to All Participants:
in treebanktokenizer why didnt it separate isn't as 'is' and ' 'nt '?
from Shashank536.sr to All Participants:
is'nt ??
from Shashank536.sr to All Participants:
why its not applicable for is'nt??
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
how do we decide which tokenizer to use when?
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
whitespacetokenizer only looks for white spaces but wordtokenizer lookes white spaces and others too right
from Mohammed Roshan Zameer to All Participants:
a search engine has been programmed to ignore stop words
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
yes
from Gitanjali.nandi to All Participants:
yes
from Vibhutimayekar to All Participants:
ok
from Kaushik.banerjee to All Participants:
y

from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
yepp
from Mukammilbasha90 to All Participants:
s
from Mohammed Roshan Zameer to All Participants:
yeah
from Shrikaantbhardwaj to All Participants:
Can someone please share the link to code
from Mukammilbasha90 to All Participants:
s
from S.chebrolu to All Participants:
do we have option to develop and use custom tokenizers ?
from Vishnu Kumar to All Participants:
what is 
from Amol Suhas bhimanwar to All Participants:
which stemmer is to be used when?
from Gurpreet Deol to All Participants:
Snowball performed better than rest
from Justrawraza007 to All Participants:
sir plz repeat stemmer
from Vishnu Kumar to All Participants:
poster stemmer
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
so porter stemmer is not performing well in this case
from Mukammilbasha90 to All Participants:
s
from Amol Suhas bhimanwar to All Participants:
can we apply stemmer one after other for better stemming?
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
I have one question
from Mili Juneja to All Participants:
why have we taken location as {0:20}, whats 20
from Amol Suhas bhimanwar to All Participants:
ok
from S.chebrolu to All Participants:
Lemmetizer would not give like this ... so seems like lemmetizer is better ...
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
do we have one comprehensive package where it removes Number, Punctuations, stop words etc together?
from S.chebrolu to All Participants:
yeah
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
sir is it all lemmatizer have same capabilities. if yes then how they differ
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
stemming*
from Mukammilbasha90 to All Participants:
s
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
sir why we use {0:20} like this everywhere what does it infer
from Rai.coldcharm to All Participants:
how do we know which stemmer works well... it seems all three are messing up..do we need to manually fix each mistake
from Justrawraza007 to All Participants:
exactly
from Rai.coldcharm to All Participants:
now its randomly making up words..
from Justrawraza007 to All Participants:
ok
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
in stem it does th same not taken root word why
from Chandra Sekhar Mukhopadhyay to All Participants:
ok
from S.chebrolu to All Participants:
On what basis does the stemming work? on what basis it removes the letters  from the words?
from Rai.coldcharm to All Participants:
is there a better package for stemmer?
from Thangarajkothai to All Participants:
what algo does the stemming use??
from Rai.coldcharm to All Participants:
lemmatization keeps dictionary rather than using some messed up logic for stemming

from V.prithviraj99 to All Participants:
there is a trade off so decision should be realistic 
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
but for interview perspective , do we need to know all?
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
ok...
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
do we have one comprehensive package where it removes Number, Punctuations, stop words etc together?
from Justrawraza007 to All Participants:
sir when we will use stemmer and lemmatizer
from Gurpreet Deol to All Participants:
It seems correct
from Mukammilbasha90 to All Participants:
can you please show me the real time data  in nlp 
from Mohammed Roshan Zameer to All Participants:
this topic is kinda lengthy
from Justrawraza007 to All Participants:
ohhh
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
hmm
from Asdeshmukh151 to All Participants:
is lammatiser take care of tense than stemmer
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
its much bettre than stemmer
from Gurpreet Deol to All Participants:
What is 'v' and 'n'?
from Vibhutimayekar to All Participants:
can v skip stemmer and go for lemmetizer?
from Maryghosh1910 to All Participants:
what is v and n
from Justrawraza007 to All Participants:
is this all for today
from Gurpreet Deol to All Participants:
ok
from Mohammed Roshan Zameer to All Participants:
Lol, i'm sleepy
from Vibhutimayekar to All Participants:
no no i talking usually while coding
from S.chebrolu to All Participants:
what is the difference in lemmetizers? do they use thier own specific look up table?
from S.chebrolu to All Participants:
sasi bhushan
from S.chebrolu to All Participants:
thanks
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
sir could we also get to know about other lemmatization methods
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
or which one is better
from Contactsahilshetty18  to All Participants:
Sir how do we use this on imbalanced datasets
from Mukammilbasha90 to All Participants:
no
from Vibhutimayekar to All Participants:
u r going to show a example on unstructured data right?
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
sir could we also get to know about other lemmatization methods
or which one is better
from Vibhutimayekar to All Participants:
kies
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
do we have one comprehensive package where it removes Number, Punctuations, stop words etc together?
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
ok ..got it
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
yes
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
yes
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
is it possible to run NLTK libraries in local with 8 GB RAM?

from Mohammed Roshan Zameer to All Participants:
.
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
is it like taking subset of whole
from Abhishek Upadhyay to All Participants:
yes
from Vibhutimayekar to All Participants:
okeh
from Vibhutimayekar to All Participants:
so grams include stopwords too
from Vaishusony8 to All Participants:
but how do we know if we need to use 1 gram or 2 gram...?
from Mailsforsarath98 to All Participants:
before this we will remove the stopwords not??
from Gitanjali.nandi to All Participants:
if it is a big paraghaph how to decide n gram
from rapoluvamsh to All Participants:
what is the use of taking same word in 2 sentences
from Vaishusony8 to All Participants:
but if there is huge data it takes a lot of time deciding number of n?
from Saroj.bisi to All Participants:
so all these word combinations will be treated as one token?
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
sir what is the use of such bigram as it creates redundancy
from Malathi.gbican  to All Participants:
bigram we are using in list
from Contactsahilshetty18  to All Participants:
Sir can you explain briefly what is n gram again please?
from Mailsforsarath98 to All Participants:
frequency
from Sbsen_21 to All Attendees:
whare is the use of n_grams?
from Vaishusony8 to All Participants:
it will split words according to number of n
from Anjal Angrevar to All Participants:
yes sir, please explain again ngram
from Santhi_kuppam to All Participants:
what are the numbers?
from Shyam1944 to All Participants:
dOES THE CODE CONVERT TEXT IN TO LOWER CAE UTOMATIOCALLY?
from Malathi.gbican  to All Participants:
case sensitive
from Vibhutimayekar to All Participants:
ok
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
yes
from Mailsforsarath98 to All Participants:
sir can you pls go back to n-grams
from Sbsen_21 to All Attendees:
plz move up?
from Vaishusony8 to All Participants:
pls explain counter number
from nkusare to All Participants:
yes
from Santhi_kuppam to All Participants:
but when n = 3 was declared, 2 words got displayed
from Sajalkirti to All Participants:
how to decide which value is good, 
from Kaushik.banerjee to All Participants:
last one is 2
from Kaushik.banerjee to All Participants:
the object
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
sir what is the use of such bigram as it creates redundancy
from Kaushik.banerjee to All Participants:
in 3 gram
from Gurpreet Deol to All Participants:
there is . also
from Kaushik.banerjee to All Participants:
ok..
from Vibhutimayekar to All Participants:
trigram takes ','
from nkusare to All Participants:
in earlier case, we din write trigrams, hence it could not execute, when you changed it to 3
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
sir what is the use of such bigram as it creates redundancy
from nkusare to All Participants:
yes here...
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
yes sir
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
got it
from nkusare to All Participants:
ok
from Mohammed Roshan Zameer to All Participants:
ok
from Mohammed Roshan Zameer to All Participants:
interesting
from nkusare to All Participants:
what if we write "licit"?
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
it is because we not executed upper part also
from Sajalkirti to All Participants:
u did not execute ''IS
from Gurpreet Deol to All Participants:
Bag of words
from nkusare to All Participants:
ok
from RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN to All Participants:
so case_sensitive make permanent what we changed right?
from nkusare to All Participants:
yes
from nkusare to All Participants:
